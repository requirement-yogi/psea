    No suppression for the moment

    See https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/blob/main/core/src/main/resources/dependencycheck-base-suppression.xml
        for the format

    You would add a suppression if:
                - If the -Pvulnerability build returns a vulnerability,
                - If it is NOT possible to upgrade the corresponding library
                - If you have checked that we are not vulnerable.
